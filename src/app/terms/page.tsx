              1. Site Overview
            </h2>
            <h3>1.1 About the Site</h3>
            <p>
              The Site aggregates and publishes publicly available third-party
              information about:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The Voltr Protocol Smart Contract System deployed on Solana;
              </li>
              <li>
                Various decentralized finance (DeFi) yield vaults and
                strategies;
              </li>
              <li>
                Tokens that exist and have been or may be made available by
                third parties known as &quot;vault managers&quot; in connection
                with vault strategies;
              </li>
              <li>
                The implied or express fair market prices of tokens and vault
                shares;
              </li>
              <li>
                Performance metrics, yields, and historical data related to
                vault strategies;
              </li>
              <li>
                Transaction records on Solana relating to vault deposits,
                withdrawals, and strategy execution.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The Site also offers interaction methods whereby the User can
              indicate a transaction the User would like to perform in
              connection with vault strategies (such as depositing tokens into a
              vault or withdrawing from a vault). When used in this way, the
              Site can generate a draft transaction message which the User can
              independently utilize in conjunction with a third-party wallet
              application or device to conduct transactions on Solana.
            </p>

            <h3>1.2 About Voltr Protocol</h3>
            <p>
              Voltr Protocol is a smart contract infrastructure system deployed
              on the Solana blockchain that enables automated yield generation
              through various DeFi strategies. The protocol consists of vault
              smart contracts and strategy adapters that interact with different
              DeFi protocols including but not limited to Drift, Marginfi,
              Solend, and Kamino. The protocol provides permissionless
              infrastructure for yield optimization managed by independent
              third-party vault managers.
            </p>

            <h3>1.3 Relationship to Voltr Protocol and Vault Strategies</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>
                IMPORTANT: The Site and Services operate independently of vault
                managers and individual vault strategies, and the Site Operator
                does not own, operate, control, or manage any individual vaults
                or their underlying strategies.
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Using Solana or individual vault strategies does not require use
              of the Site. The Site aggregates and publishes publicly available
              information about Solana and various vault strategies in a
              user-friendly and convenient format. Such information is also
              independently available from other sources.
            </p>
            <p>
              By combining publicly available information with the User&apos;s
              interactions with the Site, the Site can draft standard
              transaction messages compatible with vault strategies which are
              designed to accomplish the User&apos;s operational goals as expressed
              through the interactions. If the User so wishes, the User may
              broadcast such messages to Solana in order to initiate token
              transactions.
            </p>
            <p>
              All draft transaction messages are delivered by the Site via API
              to a compatible third-party Solana wallet application or device
              selected by the User after pressing the &quot;Connect Wallet&quot;
              button on the Site. The User must personally review and authorize
              all transaction messages that the User wishes to send to Solana;
              this requires the User to sign the relevant transaction message
              with a private cryptographic key inaccessible to the Site.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>
                The Site Operator and the Site are not agents or intermediaries
                of the User, do not store or have access to or control over any
                tokens, private keys, passwords, accounts or other property of
                the User, and are not capable of performing transactions or
                sending transaction messages on behalf of the User. The Site
                does not hold and cannot purchase, sell or trade any tokens. All
                transactions relating to vault strategies are effected and
                recorded solely through the interactions of the User with the
                Solana blockchain and individual vault managers, who are not
                under the control of or affiliated with the Site Operator or the
                Site.

              3. Site Operator Discretion; Certain Risks of the Site
            </h2>
            <p>
              Each User hereby acknowledges and agrees and consents to, and
              assumes all risk associated with the Site and Services, including
              the matters described in this Section 3.
            </p>
            <h3>3.1 Content and Information</h3>
            <p>
              Site Operator makes no representations or warranties as to the
              quality, origin, accuracy, or completeness of any content found on
              or available through the Site. All vault performance data, yield
              calculations, and strategy information displayed on the Site are
              provided for informational purposes only and may not be accurate
              or up-to-date. Site Operator shall not be liable for any errors,
              misrepresentations, or omissions in, of, and about, the content,
              nor for the availability of the content.
            </p>
            <h3>3.2 Vault and Token Information</h3>
            <p>
              In providing information about vaults and tokens, the Site
              associates or presumes the association of a vault name, strategy
              description, or token symbol with specific smart contracts
              deployed to Solana. In making such associations, the Site relies
              upon third-party resources which may not be accurate or may not
              conform to a given User&apos;s expectations. Multiple smart contracts
              can utilize the same token name or vault strategy name as one
              another. Users must not rely on the name, symbol or branding of a
              vault or token on the Site, but instead must examine the specific
              smart contract associated with the name, symbol or branding and
              confirm that the vault or token accords with User&apos;s expectations.
            </p>
            <h3>3.3 User Responsibility for Accounts & Security</h3>
            <p>
              Users are solely responsible for all matters relating to their
              accounts, wallets, addresses, private keys and tokens and for
              ensuring that all uses thereof comply fully with these Terms.
              Users are solely responsible for protecting the data integrity and
              confidentiality of their private keys for any wallet applications
              or devices used in connection with the Site.
            </p>
            <h3>3.4 No Site Fees; Third-Party Fees</h3>
            <p>
              There are no fees or charges imposed by Site Operator for use of
              the Site. However, use of vault strategies and use of Solana is
              subject to third-party transaction fees and vault management fees
              imposed by vault managers. The Site Operator does not receive such
              fees and has no ability to reverse or refund any amounts paid in
              error.
            </p>
            <h3>3.5 No Obligation to Continue Operations</h3>
            <p>
              The Site is operated and maintained in the sole and absolute
              discretion of the Site Operator. The Site Operator assumes no
              duties, liabilities, obligations or undertakings to continue
              operating or maintaining the availability of the Site and may
              terminate or change the Site in any or all respects at any time.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Site Operator has no obligation to ensure that the Site
              displays information about all available vaults or strategies.
              Even if the Site currently displays a particular vault or
              strategy, the Site may discontinue tracking and publishing
              information about that vault or strategy at any time, in the Site
              Operator&apos;s sole and absolute discretion.
            </p>
            <h3>3.6 Site Operator May Deny or Limit Access</h3>
            <p>
              The Site Operator reserves the right to terminate or limit any
              person&apos;s access to or use of the Site at any time, with or without
              notice, as determined in the Site Operator&apos;s sole and absolute
              discretion. Such terminations and limitations may be based on any
